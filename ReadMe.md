Draw With ME

Overview:
This is a collaborative drawing app designed to allow users to add their own edits to a shared drawing, using different pen colors and widths. Users can send their drawings to other users of the app, and receive them from those other users. DrawWithMe seeks to bring creativity and collaboration into our busy lives through the capabilities of the mobile device. The person who receives the image can add to the picture by drawing over it, or drawing another image in sequence to the first to create a story. The pair can continue to send the picture(s) back and forth until they reach a stopping point, and enjoy their masterpiece by saving it to their phones!
